#100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Tracy Bonham

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 24, Monday, 2022

##Log


#R1D1
Started with Front End Development Libraries - React [freecodecamp]

#R1D2
Worked more with React and properities (passing props, default props, overriding default props). 
This is something that I struggle with so the practice helps.

#R1D3
Continued to work with React, but the lessons from freecodecamp are a little outdated, so I'm basically learning (old) new stuff. 
It's a bit confusing and makes me apreciate version 17, and how much easier they made it.

#R1D4
Continued to work with React, the lessons from freecodecamp. Learned about this.state and binding.

#R1D5
I played some CSS games, Flexbox Froggy and started Grid Garden to sharpen my skills!

#R1D6
Worked on some more React on FreeCodeCamp. 

#R1D7
I finished the React portion of the outdated FreeCodeCamp ( was not really feeling it ) The this.prop.whatever was soooo confusing.

#R1D8
Going back to basic so I don't reget basic HTML and CSS. LOL

#R1D9
Working on more HTML but with tables!


#R1D10
I'm in the process of making a pure HTML website project just to get practice in.

##Back to day one
#R1D1
I fell a week behind due to being busy with getting everything squared away with a new job, and pretty much life happened. But I'm not stopping, just have to start the clock over. Here I go, still swimming. :)

#R1D2
I am recording my fails also. It will help me see my full journey in becomes who and what I am. I've got this.
I didn't write code but I had a conversation about CMS and read up on them.

#R1D3
Really sticking with some hard core CSS learning.

#R1D4
Learning and working more with CSS.

Learning about diffrent terminologies.

#R1D6
Back to CSS.

#R1D7
Couldn't get to any coding until late, but pulled it off! Boy, do I love codecademy!

#R1D8
Trucking along with CSS still.

#R1D8,9,10
I didn't save my progress on here! Grrr...

#R1D11
I watched a couple of (what is) UX videos. I just wanted to see what the design side of websites is like. You, since that is kinda what my new job will be like.

#RD12
I made a simple JS bg color changer and pushed it to GitHub. :)

#R1D13
I made a simple js mouse over photo gallery webpage.

#R1D14, 15, 16
I didn't get a change to record what I did. BUT, I did on Twitter! Started to learn about UX.

#R1D17
I built a React tic tax toe app from the tutorial that is on reactjs.org.

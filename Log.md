The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 24, Monday, 2022

##Log


#R1D1
Started with Front End Development Libraries - React [freecodecamp]

#R1D2
Worked more with React and properities (passing props, default props, overriding default props). This is something that I struggle with so the practice helps.

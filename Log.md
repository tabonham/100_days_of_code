##Log


#R1D1
Started with Front End Development Libraries - React [freecodecamp]

#R1D2
Worked more with React and properities (passing props, default props, overriding default props). 
This is something that I struggle with so the practice helps.

#R1D3
Continued to work with React, but the lessons from freecodecamp are a little outdated, so I'm basically learning (old) new stuff. 
It's a bit confusing and makes me apreciate version 17, and how much easier they made it.

#R1D4
Continued to work with React, the lessons from freecodecamp. Learned about this.state and binding.

#R1D5
I played some CSS games, Flexbox Froggy and started Grid Garden to sharpen my skills!

#R1D6
Worked on some more React on FreeCodeCamp. 

#R1D7
I finished the React portion of the outdated FreeCodeCamp ( was not really feeling it ) The this.prop.whatever was soooo confusing.

#R1D8
Going back to basic so I don't reget basic HTML and CSS. LOL
